# SpinalDev - Development Environment for SpinalHDL

[SpinalHDL](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalHDL) is a hardware description language (HDL). SpinalHDL is based on Scala and allows for high level constructs. This repository contains a **Dockerfile** for FPGA/ASIC development with SpinalHDL. The Dockerfile is mostly based on the instructions found at <https://spinalhdl.github.io/SpinalDoc>. The container includes a number of tools, libraries and dependencies based around SpinalHDL.

## Getting Started

The best way to get started is to download the image for this
container directly from Doc Hub and then run the container and play
inside it. Here are the steps for Ubuntu.

   1. Install docker client (e.g. see [docker docks](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce))
   2. Get the image, either
      * get image from docker hub
        * `sudo docker pull plex1/spinaldev`
      * OR build image yourself
        * `git clone https://github.com/plex1/SpinalDev.git`
        * `cd SpinalDev/docker/main/`
        * `sudo docker build -t plex1/spinaldev` 
   3. Add X access for root
      * `xhost local:root`
   4. Run the docker container
      * `sudo docker run -it --rm -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -p 3389:3389 plex1/spinaldev:latest`
   5. You are now logged into the develoment environment as the user spinaldev

As a first step you can run the following commands. They build and test an example design.
```sh
#Go to a SpinalHDL example project
cd projects/spinal/SpinalTemplateSbt

#Generate the Verilog of the design
sbt "run-main mylib.MyTopLevelVerilog"

#Inspect generated files
ls
cat MyTopLevel.v

#Run the scala testbench
sbt "run-main mylib.MyTopLevelSim"

#Inspect the waveform of the simulation
gtkwave simWorkspace/MyTopLevel/test.vcd&

```
Have fun!


## Remote Desktop

There is a remote desktop server running in the container. To connect from linux you may execute the following command.

`rdesktop -z -P -x l -g 1024x768 127.0.0.1:3389`

Login as user spinaldev with password spinaldev. To connect from windows you may use the native remote desktop client.


## Tour of the environment

### Build the CPU
The risc-v processor can be build with the following set of commands.

```sh
#Go to a risc-v cpu
cd /home/spinaldev/projects/spinal/VexRiscv

#Generate the verilog of the cpu
sbt "run-main vexriscv.demo.GenFull"

#Inspect generated files
ls
head VexRiscv.v
```

### Run a simulation of the CPU
The cpu including software can be simulated and debugged in the container. First, we start a simulation using verilator - a verilog simulator.

```sh
#Run a simulation of the cpu with a port for OpenOCD to connect to
cd src/test/cpp/regression
make run DEBUG_PLUGIN_EXTERNAL=yes

```

The last message shows BOOT which means that the simulation is running in a process. We open a second terminal. E.g. via docker from your host:
```
docker exec -u spinaldev -it container_id bash
```
In this second terminal we run the following commands to start the OpenOCD server. The server is connected to the simulation started above.

```sh
#Start the OpenOCD server
cd /opt/openocd_riscv/
src/openocd -c "set VEXRISCV_YAML /home/spinaldev/projects/spinal/VexRiscv/cpu0.yaml" -f tcl/target/vexriscv_sim.cfg
```

We should now have two terminals open and we will open a third one (e.g. as describe above). Here we run the actual debugger and connect it to the OpenOCD server via tcp port 3333.
```sh
#Run the debugger with prebuild uart example sw
riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb ~/projects/spinal/VexRiscv/src/test/resources/elf/uart.elf
target remote localhost:3333
monitor reset halt
load
continue
```
Now, the simulation of the cpu is running and messages shoud be printed in the first terminal. Specifically, we can see the uart output of the program.

### Build the software

The Software can be compiled as follows. In this example the uart program for the briey soc is built.
```sh
# build the elf file
cd ~/projects/spinal/VexRiscvSocSoftware/projects/briey/uart
make all

#inspec the generated files
ls build/

```
